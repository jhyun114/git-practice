# My Project Plan
Note: THis document is written merely as an illustrarive example, and does not provide 
any working guide to an actual project.
### Proposal
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In orger to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) of [PvTorch](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko), and other open source softwares.
For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies 
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager
### Intallation
In a bash terminal, run the following commands (Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer):
```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
